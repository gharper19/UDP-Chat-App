## Basic Goals
- get user input: client host(automatic) and port, server host, name, 
- 2+ clients one server
- Group Chat and Server Broadcasting
- TLS Encryption

## EXTRA stuff:
- Server timeout for user activity(disconnect) and inactive server (shutdown) conditions
- inbox: show to <- vs. outbox ->
	- add option for ctrl_inbox

--

## BUGS
- Included try/catch in all user inputs for conflicting python versions
- Check on getUserList() dictionary key error  

## Issues: 
- does it run better with __init__ == __main__ 

--

## Notes: 
- recvfrom works with same buffer size on both clients
